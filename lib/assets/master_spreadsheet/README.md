This folder stores the spreadsheet published in the subreddit.

It lives on reddit (via a G doc link) and on my local laptop.

DO NOT commit the raw file to git!!!

I had to manually look up the headers from the excel with the mapping
`["ab", "Greater Region", "Specific CIty", "Username", "Club", "Additional Notes"]`
to
`["reddit_username", "club", "greater_region", "specific_city", "province", "notes"]`
